I am a PhD student in Public Policy at Northeastern University studying Development Economics and Public Policy. Prior to Northeastern, I earned my Master's in Applied Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and Bachelor's in Economics from Banaras Hindu University. My professional experience includes working as a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, where I collaborated with the NITI Aayog and Ministry of Finance, Government of India. At Development Data Lab, I contributed to developing an open-source database tracking Indian Parliamentary representation.  I also taught Statistics and Microeconomics to high school students at Delhi Government Schools. <br>

While many scholars across various disciplines have studied marginalized communities, I aim to infuse my research with my personal experiences and insights to provide a fresh perspective. I am particularly passionate about highlighting the voices and concerns of underrepresented groups in the field of economics and development, ensuring they are adequately addressed in policy considerations. <br>

My interests include social stratification, labor outcomes, and applying experimental approaches to understand how education, race, caste, class, and gender interact in economic development.

I am part of <a href="https://bahujanecon.org/" target="_blank">Bahujan Economists</a>, a platform dedicated to supporting researchers, students, aspirants, and professors from historically marginalized caste, tribal, and religious communities in the field of Economics.  <br>
