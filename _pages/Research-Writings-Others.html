### Work in Progress

**The Causal Impact of Continuing Legal Education (CLE) Requirements on Legal Outcomes** with Josh Rosen  
This research investigates whether mandatory Continuing Legal Education (CLE) requirements for practicing lawyers actually improve legal service quality and professional conduct. Leveraging the variation in CLE policies across U.S. states, the study aims to establish causal evidence on whether these educational mandates reduce malpractice rates or enhance legal service quality. The research employs multiple empirical strategies, including synthetic control methods and instrumental variables approaches, while utilizing comprehensive data from national lawyer databases and malpractice claims records. The study addresses key confounding factors such as differences in legal practice types, lawyer quality, and state-specific claiming behaviors. By examining this important question, the research contributes to broader discussions about professional licensing, human capital formation, and the effectiveness of continuing education requirements in professional services markets.

**Displacement or Expansion? The General Equilibrium Effects of EWS Quotas in Indian Higher Education**  
This research exploits India's 2019 introduction of a 10% quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as a natural experiment to study the impact of expanded affirmative action policies. The study examines how this policy change affects the composition of students in elite institutions and their subsequent labor market outcomes, particularly focusing on its impact on traditionally reserved categories (SC/ST/OBC). Using a comprehensive dataset combining administrative records, survey data, and professional network information, the research employs various empirical strategies including difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs. The study aims to provide causal evidence on both immediate compositional effects and longer-term consequences for human capital accumulation and labor market outcomes across different social groups, contributing to our understanding of efficiency-equity trade-offs in educational policy and the economics of discrimination.

### Reports

**Rationalisation of Explicit Subsidies at State Level.** (2024). National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi. NITI Aayog, Government of India Study, with Amar Nath, H. K., Nayudu, S. H., Gurdatta, M., Kishan, & Raj, A.  
*National Institute of Public Finance and Policy* ([Report Link](https://nipfp.org.in/publications/reports/1440))  
*Media Coverage: Business Standard* ([Containing Subsidies: Why States Must Reassess and Rationalise Expenditure](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/editorial/containing-subsidies-why-states-must-reassess-and-rationalise-expenditure-124082201416_1.html))  

This comprehensive study analyzes explicit subsidies across seven Indian states - Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nagaland - examining their impact on state finances. The research reveals that states spending over 20% of revenue receipts on explicit subsidies face significant revenue deficits, while those maintaining subsidies below 15% show revenue surpluses. Notably, states like Punjab and Andhra Pradesh demonstrate high subsidy expenditure, primarily on power, agriculture, and welfare schemes, while Odisha and Uttar Pradesh maintain more sustainable levels. The study proposes using the **TTTE Formula** (Targeting, Transparency, Timeline, and Evaluation) for subsidy rationalization and emphasizes linking subsidy volumes to available fiscal space. Our findings suggest that uncontrolled subsidy growth, especially in revenue-deficit states, threatens fiscal sustainability and reduces capital expenditure, offering valuable insights for policymakers on subsidy rationalization while maintaining essential welfare objectives.
