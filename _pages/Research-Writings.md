### Work in Progress

**The Causal Effect of Social Media Access on Electoral Outcomes: Evidence from Brazil's Twitter Ban** with ([Sebastián Ramirez](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/student/sebastian-ramirez/))
Exploiting Brazil's 2024 Twitter ban as a quasi-experimental shock to identify the causal impact of social media on voting behavior. Employing difference-in-differences methodology comparing border municipalities (with potential cross-border network access) to non-border municipalities. Currently constructing a municipality-level internet penetration index using PCA on data from IBGE's PNAD Contínua and Cetic.br surveys, addressing district-to-municipality harmonization challenges through population-weighted aggregation. Incorporating spatial RD and heterogeneity analysis by baseline internet penetration and bordering country.

**Displacement or Expansion? The General Equilibrium Effects of EWS Quotas in Indian Higher Education**  
The paper exploits India's 2019 introduction of a 10% quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as a natural experiment to study the impact of expanded affirmative action policies. The study examines how this policy change affects the composition of students in elite institutions and their subsequent labor market outcomes, particularly focusing on its impact on traditionally reserved categories (SC/ST/OBC). Using a comprehensive dataset combining administrative records, survey data, and professional network information, the research employs various empirical strategies including difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs. The study aims to provide causal evidence on both immediate compositional effects and longer-term consequences for human capital accumulation and labor market outcomes across different social groups, contributing to our understanding of efficiency-equity trade-offs in educational policy and the economics of discrimination.

This comprehensive study analyzes explicit subsidies across seven Indian states - Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Nagaland - examining their impact on state finances. The research reveals that states spending over 20% of revenue receipts on explicit subsidies face significant revenue deficits, while those maintaining subsidies below 15% show revenue surpluses. Notably, states like Punjab and Andhra Pradesh demonstrate high subsidy expenditure, primarily on power, agriculture, and welfare schemes, while Odisha and Uttar Pradesh maintain more sustainable levels. The study proposes using the **TTTE Formula** (Targeting, Transparency, Timeline, and Evaluation) for subsidy rationalization and emphasizes linking subsidy volumes to available fiscal space. Our findings suggest that uncontrolled subsidy growth, especially in revenue-deficit states, threatens fiscal sustainability and reduces capital expenditure, offering valuable insights for policymakers on subsidy rationalization while maintaining essential welfare objectives.
