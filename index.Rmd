I am currently a PhD student in Public Policy at Northeastern University studying Development Economics and Public Policy. I am interested in topics related to Development, Behavioral Economy and Labor Economics. 
Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, where I collaborated with NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, on projects related to subsidies and the digitization of archival budget documents. I have also worked at Development Data Lab, where I contributed to an open-source database tracking Indian parliamentary representation. In addition, I taught Statistics and Microeconomics to high school students in Delhi Government Schools.

I have a Master’s in Applied Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and Bachelor’s in Economics from Banaras Hindu University.

While many scholars across various disciplines have studied marginalized communities, I aim to infuse my research with my personal experiences and insights to provide a fresh perspective. I am particularly passionate about highlighting the voices and concerns of underrepresented groups in the field of economics and development, ensuring they are adequately addressed in policy considerations.

I am part of <a href="https://bahujanecon.org/" target="_blank">Bahujan Economists</a>, a platform dedicated to supporting researchers, students, aspirants, and professors from historically marginalized caste, tribal, and religious communities in the field of Economics. You can follow our work at: <a href="https://x.com/BahujanEcon" target="_blank">@BahujanEcon</a>.

I am proficient in use of Stata, R and Python (pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, web scraping) empirical analysis and data management.
