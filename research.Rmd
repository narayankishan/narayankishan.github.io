**Displacement or Expansion? The General Equilibrium Effects of EWS Quotas in Indian Higher Education**

The paper exploits India's 2019 introduction of a 10% quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) as a natural experiment to study the impact of expanded affirmative action policies. The study examines how this policy change affects the composition of students in elite institutions and their subsequent labor market outcomes, particularly focusing on its impact on traditionally reserved categories (SC/ST/OBC).

**Where Do Opportunity Zone Jobs Go? A Social Network Analysis of Employment Flows in Place-Based Tax Policy** (with Hitanshu Pandit)

This paper explains why the Opportunity Zone (OZ) program produced no measurable gains for residents despite large capital inflows. Using ACS and LODES data through 2022, we replicate and extend prior work and find precise null effects on resident employment, poverty, income, and—newly—on workplace employment in OZ tracts. We then show that these null effects arise from the labor-market network structure. Commuting-flow networks reveal that OZ tracts occupy peripheral, highly segregated positions with low in-degree centrality, high structural constraint, and limited connectivity to high-income labor markets. *[Draft available soon]*
