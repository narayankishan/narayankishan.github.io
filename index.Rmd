I am a PhD student in Public Policy at Northeastern University studying Development Economics and Public Policy. Prior to Northeastern, I earned my Master's in Applied Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and Bachelor's in Economics from Banaras Hindu University.

My professional experience includes working as a Research Fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, where I collaborated with the NITI Aayog and Ministry of Finance, Government of India. At Development Data Lab, I contributed to developing an open-source database tracking Indian Parliamentary representation. I also taught Statistics and Microeconomics to high school students at Delhi Government Schools.

While many scholars across various disciplines have studied marginalized communities, I aim to infuse my research with my personal experiences and insights to provide a fresh perspective. I am particularly passionate about highlighting the voices and concerns of underrepresented groups in the field of economics and development, ensuring they are adequately addressed in policy considerations.

My interests include social stratification, labor outcomes, and applying experimental approaches to understand how education, race, caste, class, and gender interact in economic development.

I am part of <a href="https://bahujanecon.org/" target="_blank">Bahujan Economists</a>, a platform dedicated to supporting researchers, students, aspirants, and professors from historically marginalized caste, tribal, and religious communities in the field of Economics.
